# Prompt Engineering Guide for Insurance LLM Framework

This guide explains how to design effective prompts for insurance-specific tasks using the Insurance LLM Framework.

## Introduction to Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting input text to effectively guide large language models (LLMs) to produce desired outputs. In the insurance domain, this involves designing prompts that:

1. Incorporate domain-specific terminology and concepts
2. Follow specific structures appropriate for insurance documents
3. Elicit outputs that comply with regulatory requirements
4. Generate content with appropriate tone and professionalism

## Prompt Strategies Available in the Framework

The Insurance LLM Framework supports several prompt engineering strategies:

### 1. Zero-Shot Prompting

**Description:** Instructing the model without providing examples, relying on its pre-trained knowledge.

**Best for:**
- Simple tasks with clear instructions
- Tasks where the model likely has strong prior knowledge
- Quick testing and iteration

**Example:**
```
You are an AI assistant trained to summarize insurance policies clearly and accurately.

Please provide a concise summary of the following insurance policy. Focus on key coverage areas, limits, exclusions, and important conditions.

Policy Document:
{policy_text}

Summary:
```

### 2. Few-Shot Prompting

**Description:** Providing the model with examples of desired input-output pairs before asking it to complete a new task.

**Best for:**
- Establishing specific formats or styles
- Teaching the model patterns for complex tasks
- Improving consistency across outputs

**Example:**
```
You are an AI assistant that generates professional responses to insurance claims.

Here are some examples:

Claim: The insured's vehicle was damaged in a parking lot by an unknown driver who left the scene.
Response: After reviewing your claim regarding the parking lot incident, we can approve coverage under your Collision policy. Your deductible of $500 will apply. Please submit repair estimates from an approved shop to proceed.

Claim: Water damage occurred when the insured's washing machine hose broke, flooding the laundry room and kitchen.
Response: We have reviewed your claim for water damage caused by the broken washing machine hose. This incident is covered under your homeowner's policy's sudden and accidental water damage provision. Your deductible of $1,000 will apply. Please submit the contractor's estimate and receipts for any emergency mitigation services.

Now, please generate a professional response to the following claim:

Claim: {claim_text}
Response:
```

### 3. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting

**Description:** Encouraging the model to break down complex tasks into intermediate reasoning steps.

**Best for:**
- Complex decision-making tasks
- Risk assessments
- Policy interpretation
- Claim adjudication reasoning

**Example:**
```
You are an AI assistant trained to analyze insurance claims.

When analyzing a claim, think through the following steps:
1. Identify the policy type and coverage limits
2. Determine if the incident falls within the policy's coverage
3. Check for any exclusions or limitations that might apply
4. Consider deductibles and coverage limits
5. Formulate a recommendation based on policy terms

Claim to analyze: {claim_text}

Let's think through this step by step:
```

### 4. ReAct Prompting

**Description:** Combines reasoning and acting in an interleaved manner, allowing the model to reflect on previous steps.

**Best for:**
- Complex workflows requiring multiple decisions
- Situations requiring information gathering and analysis
- Underwriting processes

**Example:**
```
You are an AI assistant for insurance underwriting.

To evaluate insurance applications, you'll need to:
1. Thought: Reflect on what information you need to evaluate
2. Action: Identify which parts of the application to review
3. Observation: Note key details from the application
4. Thought: Consider risk factors and appropriate pricing
5. Action: Determine policy eligibility and premium calculation
6. Observation: Check if the calculated premium aligns with risk profile

Insurance application: {application_text}

Start the underwriting process:

## Best Practices for Insurance Prompts

### 1. Use Insurance-Specific Terminology

Include relevant insurance terminology in your prompts to help the model understand the context:

✅ **Good:** "Review this auto policy to identify coverage limits, deductibles, and exclusions related to collision and comprehensive coverage."

❌ **Poor:** "Look at this document and tell me what it covers."

### 2. Specify the Audience

Insurance communications have different requirements based on the audience:

✅ **Good:** "Generate a claim denial letter for a policyholder that explains the policy exclusions in clear, non-technical language."

❌ **Poor:** "Write a letter explaining why the claim is denied."

### 3. Include Regulatory Context

When relevant, specify the regulatory context to ensure compliance:

✅ **Good:** "Draft a response to this claim in accordance with [State] insurance regulations, including the required disclosures about appeals processes."

❌ **Poor:** "Write a response to this claim."

### 4. Structure Output Format

Provide clear instructions about the desired output format:

✅ **Good:** "Create a structured risk assessment report with the following sections: Executive Summary, Identified Risks, Risk Analysis, Mitigation Recommendations, and Conclusion."

❌ **Poor:** "Assess the risks for this business."

### 5. Prompt Refinement Process

Follow this iterative process to refine prompts:

1. **Start Simple:** Begin with a basic prompt
2. **Test:** Generate outputs and evaluate results
3. **Identify Issues:** Note any problems with the output
4. **Refine:** Adjust the prompt to address issues
5. **Constrain:** Add guardrails to prevent unwanted content
6. **Re-test:** Generate new outputs and evaluate
7. **Iterate:** Continue refining until satisfied

## Prompt Templates in the Framework

The Insurance LLM Framework provides pre-built templates for common insurance tasks. These templates are located in the `prompts/templates/` directory and can be accessed through the Prompt Library interface in the application.

### Example Template Structure

```json
{
  "name": "policy_summary_concise",
  "template": "You are an AI assistant trained to summarize insurance policies clearly and accurately.\n\nPlease provide a concise summary of the following insurance policy. Focus on key coverage areas, limits, exclusions, and important conditions.\n\nPolicy Document:\n{policy_text}\n\nSummary:",
  "task_type": "policy_summary",
  "description": "Concise summary of an insurance policy",
  "variables": ["policy_text"],
  "strategy_type": "zero_shot",
  "metadata": {
    "recommended_models": ["llama2-7b-chat", "mistral-7b-instruct"],
    "example_input": {
      "policy_text": "AUTO INSURANCE POLICY\nPolicy Number: AP-12345678\n..."
    },
    "creation_date": "2023-06-15"
  }
}
```

## Evaluating and Improving Prompts

The framework provides tools to evaluate prompt effectiveness:

1. Use the Evaluation page to compare outputs from different prompts
2. Review automated metrics like relevance and completeness
3. Collect human evaluations for subjective assessment
4. Use the Benchmarks page to test prompt performance on standard datasets
5. Iterate on prompts based on evaluation results

## Advanced Techniques

### Template Variables

Use variables to make prompts more flexible:
- `{policy_text}` - The text of an insurance policy
- `{claim_details}` - Information about a claim
- `{customer_inquiry}` - A customer's question
- `{regulations}` - Relevant regulatory guidelines

### System and User Messages

For models that support chat formats:
- System messages establish the assistant's role and constraints
- User messages provide the specific content to be processed

### Contextual Control

Control different aspects of the generated content:
- Tone: "Use a professional, empathetic tone appropriate for insurance communications."
- Complexity: "Explain insurance concepts at a 9th-grade reading level."
- Format: "Structure the response with clear sections and bullet points for readability."

## Conclusion

Effective prompt engineering is crucial for getting high-quality, reliable outputs from LLMs in the insurance domain. By following the guidelines in this document and leveraging the tools provided by the Insurance LLM Framework, you can design prompts that generate accurate, compliant, and useful insurance content.
