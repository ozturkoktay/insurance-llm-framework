**Best for**:
- Comparing generated summaries to reference summaries
- Assessing content coverage when a reference is available

**Interpretation**:
- Higher scores indicate better overlap with reference text
- Useful for checking if key information is preserved

### 2. BLEU Metric

**Description**: Evaluates the precision of n-grams in the generated text compared to reference text.

**Best for**:
- Assessing translation-like tasks
- Checking adherence to specific reference phrasings

**Interpretation**:
- Scores range from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating better precision
- Less sensitive to content ordering than some other metrics

### 3. Relevance Metric

**Description**: Measures how well the generated content addresses the specific topic or query.

**Best for**:
- Evaluating responses to customer inquiries
- Ensuring claim responses address the specific claim

**Interpretation**:
- Higher scores indicate more relevant content

### 4. Content Completeness Metric

**Description**: Evaluates whether the generated content covers all required elements or sections.

**Best for**:
- Checking if policy summaries include all key coverage types
- Ensuring claim responses address all aspects of a claim

**Interpretation**:
- Scores based on the presence of expected content sections
- Configurable based on the specific requirements of each task

### 5. Complexity Metric

**Description**: Measures the readability and language complexity of the generated content.

**Best for**:
- Ensuring customer communications are at an appropriate reading level
- Checking if technical content is simplified for general audiences

**Interpretation**:

- Based on established readability formulas

### 6. Compliance Metric

**Description**: Checks if the generated content includes required phrases and avoids prohibited ones.

**Best for**:
- Ensuring regulatory compliance in communications
- Checking adherence to company communication policies

**Interpretation**:
- Higher scores indicate better compliance with requirements
- Configurable based on specific regulatory contexts

## Human Evaluation Framework

While automated metrics provide valuable insights, human evaluation is essential for assessing subjective aspects of content quality. The framework includes:

### Evaluation Forms

Pre-built evaluation forms for different insurance tasks, including:

#### Policy Summary Evaluation

Criteria:
- **Accuracy**: Does the summary accurately reflect the content of the original policy?
- **Completeness**: Does the summary include all key information from the policy?
- **Clarity**: Is the summary clear and easy to understand?
- **Conciseness**: Is the summary appropriately concise without omitting key information?

#### Claim Response Evaluation

Criteria:
- **Accuracy**: Is the response accurate regarding policy details and claim information?
- **Professionalism**: Is the response professional and appropriate for a customer?
- **Helpfulness**: Is the response helpful and informative for the customer?
- **Compliance**: Does the response comply with insurance regulations and best practices?

#### Customer Communication Evaluation

Criteria:
- **Clarity**: Is the communication clear and easy to understand?
- **Empathy**: Does the communication show appropriate empathy and understanding?
- **Relevance**: Is the communication relevant to the customer's inquiry or situation?
- **Actionability**: Does the communication provide clear next steps or actionable information?

### Scoring Rubrics

Each criterion includes a detailed rubric with scores from 1-5:

```
Criterion: Accuracy
1: Very inaccurate, contains major factual errors
2: Somewhat inaccurate, contains minor factual errors
3: Moderately accurate, with some omissions or misrepresentations
4: Mostly accurate, with minimal errors or omissions
5: Completely accurate, no errors or omissions
```

### Conducting Human Evaluations

To conduct human evaluations:

1. Navigate to the Evaluation page in the application
2. Select "Human Evaluation" tab
3. Choose the task type and appropriate evaluation form
4. Input the original text and the generated text
5. Rate each criterion according to the rubric
6. Add optional comments for each criterion
7. Submit the evaluation

## Benchmarks for Standardized Evaluation

The framework includes benchmark datasets for standardized evaluation across different models and prompts:

### Available Benchmarks

- **Policy Summary Benchmark**: Standardized set of insurance policies with reference summaries
- **Claim Response Benchmark**: Collection of claims with reference responses
- **Customer Inquiry Benchmark**: Set of customer inquiries with reference answers

### Using Benchmarks

To use benchmarks for evaluation:

1. Navigate to the Benchmarks page in the application
2. Select a benchmark dataset
3. Choose the model and prompt to evaluate
4. Run the benchmark test
5. Review the results across multiple metrics
6. Compare performance against other models or prompts

- **Efficiency**: Consider performance relative to model size and inference speed
- **Consistency**: Evaluate consistency across multiple examples

## Evaluation Best Practices

### 1. Use Multiple Metrics

Rely on a combination of metrics to get a comprehensive view of output quality:

✅ **Good**: Evaluate policy summaries using relevance, completeness, complexity, and human accuracy ratings
❌ **Poor**: Rely solely on ROUGE scores to evaluate policy summaries

### 2. Consider Context

Adapt evaluation criteria based on the specific context:

✅ **Good**: Adjust expected complexity based on whether content is for customers or insurance professionals
❌ **Poor**: Use the same evaluation criteria for all content regardless of audience or purpose

### 3. Balance Automated and Human Evaluation

Use both approaches for a well-rounded assessment:

✅ **Good**: Use automated metrics for initial screening and human evaluation for deeper quality assessment
❌ **Poor**: Rely exclusively on either automated or human evaluation

### 4. Establish Baselines

Compare new models or prompts against established baselines:
