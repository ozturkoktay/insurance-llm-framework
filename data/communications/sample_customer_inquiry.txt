Subject: Question about my homeowner's policy coverage for water damage

Dear ABC Insurance,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Jane Doe, and I am a policyholder with policy number HP-98765432 for my home at 456 Elm Street, Anytown, USA.

Last night, we had a severe rainstorm, and I noticed some water leaking through my ceiling in the upstairs bathroom. It appears to be coming from the roof. The water has caused some damage to the ceiling drywall, and there's also some water damage to the bathroom floor.

I would like to know if this type of damage is covered under my homeowner's policy. I understand that I have a $1,000 deductible, but I'm not sure if roof leaks are covered or if they fall under some exclusion.

Additionally, if this is covered, could you please explain the claims process? Should I get a contractor to look at the roof first, or should I file a claim and have an adjuster inspect the damage?

I've taken pictures of the damage which I can provide if needed. I'm concerned about potential mold if this isn't addressed soon, especially with more rain forecasted for next week.

Thank you for your assistance with this matter. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Jane Doe
